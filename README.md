A crawler to test html5 features among different websites. The crawler is written in python and leverages phantomJS to access websites. The amount of used processes to crawl can be adjusted. Results of crawls are saved in a mysql database.

The necessary website file is not supplied within this project, but can be downloaded at http://www.alexa.com/. A ruby script is included in the project to remove possible duplicates from the csv file.
